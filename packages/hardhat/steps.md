Certainly, building a project with these functionalities involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create this project from scratch using Hardhat, Next.js, and Scaffold-eth:

**Step 1: Set Up the Project**

1. **Create a New Directory**: Create a new directory for your project.

2. **Initialize Hardhat**: Inside your project directory, initialize Hardhat by running `npx hardhat` and follow the setup steps.

3. **Create Next.js App**: Inside your project directory, create a new Next.js app by running `npx create-next-app`.

**Step 2: Implement User Roles and Authentication**

1. **Set Up User Authentication**: Use Next.js authentication libraries like `next-auth` or `react-query` to set up user authentication with different roles (Admin, Verifier).

**Step 3: Smart Contract Development**

1. **Create Smart Contracts**: Write Solidity smart contracts for student registration, document generation, and verification. Use Hardhat to compile and deploy these contracts.

**Step 4: Student Registration**

1. **Student Registration Page**: Create a page in your Next.js app where the "Recorder" admin can input basic student information like name, roll number, etc.

2. **Interact with Smart Contract**: Use Scaffold-eth to interact with the smart contract and store student data on the blockchain.

**Step 5: Document Generator**

1. **Document Generation Page**: Create a page for the "Document Generator" admin to input student details and marks.

2. **PDF Generation**: Use a PDF generation library (e.g., `pdf-lib`, `jsPDF`, or Python's `reportlab`) to create the result PDF based on university templates and student data.

**Step 6: IPFS Integration**

1. **IPFS Upload**: Integrate IPFS to upload the generated PDF along with the verifier's public key (hashed) as metadata.

**Step 7: Certificate Generation**

1. **Generate Certificates**: Extend the PDF generation to create both semester marksheet and degree diploma certificates based on the student's data.

**Step 8: Student Dashboard**

1. **Student Dashboard Page**: Create a student dashboard page where students can view their generated certificates.

**Step 9: Automation and Chainlink Keepers**

1. **Chainlink Keepers Integration**: Integrate Chainlink Keepers to automate certain processes like triggering certificate generation based on specific events.

**Step 10: Testing and Deployment**

1. **Testing**: Perform thorough testing of your application, including frontend components, smart contracts, and integrations.

2. **Deployment**: Deploy your Next.js app on a suitable hosting platform. Deploy your smart contracts on a blockchain testnet or mainnet.

**Step 11: Documentation and Maintenance**

1. **Documentation**: Document your project's architecture, components, and how to run it. Include information about how different functionalities work.

2. **Maintenance**: Regularly update and maintain your project to fix bugs, add new features, and keep up with changes in libraries and tools.

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and each step involves several sub-steps and coding activities. You'll need to delve deeper into various technologies like Hardhat, Next.js, Solidity, IPFS, PDF generation, Chainlink Keepers, and more. Don't hesitate to explore online tutorials, documentation, and communities related to each technology to gain a deeper understanding and successfully implement your project.
