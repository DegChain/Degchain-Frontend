I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed, but completing a project like this in just 5 hours is a challenging task. Given the complexity of the requirements you've mentioned and the need to set up smart contracts, front-end interfaces, and potentially integrate with databases, it's important to manage your expectations realistically.

Here's a simplified plan that you can follow in the limited time you have:

1. **Prioritize Tasks:**

    - Focus on the most essential parts of the project. Given the time constraints, you might need to skip some features or simplify others.

2. **Smart Contracts:**

    - Start with creating the core smart contracts. It seems like you already have a contract template. Modify and adapt this to your project's requirements.

3. **Front-End Interface:**

    - Build a basic front-end interface that interacts with the smart contracts.
    - Prioritize the functionalities mentioned in your original plan, such as user registration and document upload.

4. **Document Generation:**

    - If you're short on time, you might consider generating simple PDF documents with placeholder data instead of integrating with university templates. This could be a temporary solution.

5. **Testing:**

    - Quickly test the functionality you've implemented to identify any critical issues.

6. **Deployment:**

    - If you've used Hardhat for development, you can deploy your smart contracts on a test network like Rinkeby or a local blockchain for testing.

7. **Documentation:**

    - Make sure to document the code and functionalities you've implemented. This will be helpful for future development.

8. **Presentation:**

    - During the presentation, focus on explaining the design, architecture, and the parts you were able to implement successfully. Be transparent about any limitations due to time constraints.

9. **Future Work:**
    - After the presentation, you can continue working on the project to refine and improve its functionalities. You can integrate more complex features, like database storage, document templates, and additional automation.

Remember that project development is iterative, and it's okay if you're not able to implement everything within the given time frame. The important thing is to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts and showcase what you were able to achieve. Good luck with your project!
