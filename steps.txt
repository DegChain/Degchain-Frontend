Set up the development environment: Install Node.js, Hardhat, and Next.js. 
Create a new Next.js project and initialize a new Hardhat project inside it.

Define the smart contract: Define a smart contract using Solidity that will 
store the basic information of the student and the mark records. 
The contract should have functions for adding a new student, adding mark 
records, and generating certificates.

Write the smart contract tests: Write tests for the smart contract using Hardhat. 
Test all the functions of the contract to ensure that they work as expected.

Set up the database: Set up a database to store the basic information of the \
student and the mark records. You can use a blockchain-based database like 
OrbitDB or a traditional database like MongoDB.

Implement the Recorder functionality: Implement the Recorder functionality 
using the smart contract and the database. Create a form that allows the 
admin to enter the basic information of the student and store it in the 
database using the smart contract.

Implement the Document Generator functionality: Implement the Document 
enerator functionality using the smart contract and the database. 
Create a form that allows the admin to enter the mark records for a student 
and generate certificates using the smart contract. Use a PDF generation 
library like jsPDF or ReportLab to generate the certificates.

Implement the IPFS integration: Implement the IPFS integration to store the 
certificates in IPFS. Use the IPFS HTTP client to upload the certificates to 
IPFS and store the IPFS hash in the smart contract.

Implement the verifier public key hashing: Implement the verifier public key 
hashing to store the verifier public key in the certificate. Use a hashing 
algorithm like SHA-256 to hash the verifier public key and store the hash 
in the certificate.

Implement the automation using Chainlink Keepers: Implement the automation 
using Chainlink Keepers to automate the certificate generation process. 
Use Chainlink Keepers to trigger the certificate generation process when 
new mark records are added to the smart contract.

Implement the student dashboard: Implement the student dashboard 
using Next.js. Create a page that allows the student to view their 
certificates. Use the IPFS HTTP client to retrieve the certificates 
from IPFS and display them on the page.

Write the integration tests: Write integration tests for the entire 
application to ensure that all the components work together as expected.
